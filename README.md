# WP Hooks Locator

One of the way the WordPress theme and plugin developers find where to hook into with [add_action()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_action/) and [add_filter()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_filter/) functions is to search through the WordPress code base, plugin(s) or theme(s) or find find a reference to the hook in the codex.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/kipmyk/WP-Hooks-Locator/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0.zip) and extract the ZIP file.
2. Move the folder "WP-Hooks-Locator" to the "wp-content/plugins/" directory of your WordPress installation, e.g. via FTP.
3. Once the plugin is activated you will see 'WP Hooks Locator' in the Admin Bar at the top of your site or admin pages.
4. Clicking the 'Show Hooks' button will start showing you all the action hooks in the page you're on.
5. You can continue to navigate around until you've found the action hook you're looking for, then switch off by clicking 'Hide Hooks'.
6. Simple but effective. Enjoy!# WP-Hooks-Locator
